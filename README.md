## DomainMatcher Goals
Implement a fast algorithm which can solve the following type of matching problem.

### Full 
Full is the type of matcher that the input string must exactly equal to the pattern.

### Substr
Substr is the type of matcher that the input string must contain the pattern as a sub-string.
### Domain
Domain is the type of matcher that the input string must be a sub-domain or itself of the pattern.

## Implementation detail
A simple prototype DomainMatcher based on AC automaton
